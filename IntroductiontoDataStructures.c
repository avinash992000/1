Data Structures:
    1. Def: Organizing data in such a manner is known as data Structures.
    2. Classification of data Structures:
        1. Linear: Organizing in linear / sequential manner 
            i. Arrays:
                -> Advantages:
                    -> Faster execution
                    -> Random Access using Index value
                -> Disadvantages:
                    -> Fixed - size
            ii. Linked List:
                -> Advantages:
                    -> Grown in size
            iii. Stacks
            iv. Queues
        2. Non - Linear:
